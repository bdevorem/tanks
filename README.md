Tanks 
=====
A small two-player game, utlizing the PyGame library for 
obvious reasons and the Twisted library for real-time 
updating via the event-driven programming paradigm.  
Python 2.x.x Required  

##Usage
To run the game, first download the source code from GitHub.  
Once the code is downloaded, change directory to `tanks/`  
To enable execution, run `chmod +x host.py client.py`  
To start the two-player game, first run `./host.py` on one machine  
To start the other player, fun `./client.py` on another
  
To move, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. 
To fire, aim using the mouse and then left-click or hit the space bar.  
  
Your goal is to kill all the enemy tanks, to leave you and your 
partner in victory!
